#ESTOL

<b><i>Easily build and run Spring Framwork based Java SE applications with ESTOL!</i></b>

##### What about spring boot?
While the general aim of Spring Boot and ESTOL are similar, ESTOL is based on Spring 3.2 
and it follows a more conservative design approach with way less under-the-hood magic.

##### ESTOL?
The aviation lingo acronym ESTOL  stands for <i>Extremely Short Take-Off and Landing</i>
which describes the aim of this project in terms of Java SE main application development 
quite accurately.
