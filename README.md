#ESTOL

**Easily build and run Spring Framwork based Java SE applications with ESTOL!**

**What about spring boot?**<br/>
While the general aim of Spring Boot and ESTOL are similar, ESTOL is based on Spring 3.2 
and it follows a more conservative design approach with way less under-the-hood magic.


**ESTOL?**<br/>
The aviation lingo acronym ESTOL  stands for <i>Extremely Short Take-Off and Landing</i>
which describes the aim of this project in terms of Java SE main application development 
quite accurately.
